# Design UI hints taken from web

## MediaPlayer UI
This is a UI I really like for main MediaPlayer UI. The closer to this the better.

## MediaPlayer UI for 5" display
When dealing with 5" embedded display in the device, space starts to lack so I prefere to keep a similar layout with less informations.<br>
I like something like this, but with the same blurred colorful background instead of black

## Cards for selecting streaming service
I really like cards material design, I chose some from the web that I hope to be integrated in webapp. Main page should be just logo on the top left and cards in a grid disposure. <br>

## Cards for selecting streaming service for 5" display
As mentioned before, I think we should keep a simpler design on the smaller display. I thought this could do the trick: [icons](https://codepen.io/salvatorebattiato/pen/xxwOXer).
